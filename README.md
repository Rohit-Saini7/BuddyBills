- 🔐 Secure Authentication via Google Login (Backend-handled with Passport.js)
- 💵 Add Expenses & Split Equally (More splitting options planned!)
- 📊 Clear Balance Overview within Groups
- ✅ Easy Debt Settlement Tracking
- 📱 Installable PWA for Mobile & Desktop access

**🛠️ Technology Stack:**

- **TypeScript:** Used for both frontend and backend development for type safety.

**Frontend:**

- **Framework:** **Next.js** (Using the App Router)
- **Data Fetching/Caching:** **SWR**
- **State Management:** **React Context API** (specifically for Auth state)
- **Styling:** **Tailwind CSS** (configured during `create-next-app`)
- **API Client:** Native **`Workspace`** API (wrapped in a utility function)
- **Routing:** Next.js App Router (`next/link`, `useParams`, `useRouter`)

**Backend:**

- **Framework:** **NestJS**
- **Runtime:** **Node.js**
- **Configuration:** **`@nestjs/config`** (using `.env` files)
- **Validation:** **`class-validator`**, **`class-transformer`** (for DTOs)

**Database:**

- **Type:** **PostgreSQL**
- **Hosting Provider:** **neon.tech** (Important: Used _only_ as a managed PostgreSQL database provider, not using its Auth or other BaaS features).
- **ORM:** **TypeORM** (for database interaction in NestJS)

**Authentication (Implemented in Backend):**

- **Library:** **Passport.js** (`@nestjs/passport`, `passport`)
- **Strategies:** Google OAuth 2.0 (`passport-google-oauth20`), JWT (`passport-jwt`)
- **Tokens:** **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** (`@nestjs/jwt`)

**PWA (Progressive Web App):**

- **Library:** **`next-pwa`**
- **Manifest:** `manifest.json`
- **Service Worker:** Handled/generated by `next-pwa` (likely using Workbox internally)

**MVP Scope:**

- [x] **Authentication:** Log in using Google.
- [x] **Groups:** Create a new group. Add members to a group (maybe just by listing them initially, invite later?). View your groups.
- [x] **Expenses:** Add a new expense within a group (Amount, Description, Who Paid).
- [x] **Splitting:** Split expenses equally among all group members (simplest method first).
- [x] **Balances:** View a simple list showing the net balance of each member within a group (who owes whom overall).
- [x] **Settlement:** Record a payment made between members to settle up debts.

  **Phase 2**

- [ ] **More Flexible Expense Splitting**
- [ ] **Basic Error Correction:** (Editing/Deleting)

**🚀 Project Status:**

- Currently under passive development (MVP focus).
- Currently under active development (Phase 2 focus).
